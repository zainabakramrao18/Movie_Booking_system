# 🎬 Movie Ticket Booking System (OOP in Python)

This is a simple **console-based movie ticket booking system** built using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts in Python.  
It simulates a basic theater system where users can:

✅ Register and login  
✅ View currently running movies  
✅ See available seats  
✅ Book a seat for a show  
✅ Logout when done

## 🛠️ Features

- 👤 **User System**: Registration, Login, Logout
- 🎞️ **Movies**: Add and list currently playing movies
- 💺 **Seats**: View available seats and book a seat
- 🎟️ **Booking Validation**: Prevent double booking
- 🖥️ **Console-based User Interaction**
- 🧩 **Clean OOP Structure** (encapsulation, modular design)

## 🧠 OOP Concepts Used

- **Classes & Objects**: `User`, `UserSystem`, `Movie`, `Seat`, `Theater`, `BookingSystem`
- **Encapsulation**: Data and behaviors grouped inside classes
- **Composition**: Theater has movies and seats; Booking system uses user management
- **Modularity**: Each feature is separated cleanly across classes
